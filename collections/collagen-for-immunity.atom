    <td colspan="2"><h2>Description</h2>
<p><meta charset="utf-8">Bursting with the juicy, vibrant taste of fresh purple grapes, it’s the perfect refreshment to energise your day while supporting your glow goals. Packed with powerful beauty benefits, this collagen powder is more than a drink—it’s your daily boost for radiant skin, strong nails, healthy hair, and happy joints!</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider all your beauty and wellness needs taken care of. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 15 grams of heavy-hitting Hydrolysed Bovine Collagen Peptides per serving, our collagen powder — pure, 100% grass-fed, and pasture-raised — is not here to mess around. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientifically formulated for fast absorption, our Premium Collagen Peptides work quickly to support hair, nail, and skin health; improve joint function; and nourish the gut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other youth-preserving ingredients include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitamin C (adored for its ability to boost natural collagen production)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyaluronic Acid (a humectant that attracts and retains moisture for joint lubrication and plumped-up skin)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biotin (a B vitamin crucial for energy production and, thus, healthy hair, skin, and nails)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>100% Hydrolysed Collagen Peptides (Bovine)</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hydrolyzed bioactive collagen from grass-fed, pasture-raised bovine. A tailored blend that stimulates type 1, type 2 and type 3 collagen. Combined, these promote healthy hair, skin and nails, improve joint function and support gut health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Essential for collagen biosynthesis and the formation of collagen fibres. Vitamin C is also a powerful antioxidant that boosts the immune system and helps the body absorb iron. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A polysaccharide that occurs naturally in your skin. Hyaluronic Acid acts like a tiny sponge that pulls in water to quench and plump skin–giving it that dewy, glowy effect. It also keeps the joints lubricated and helps preserve bone strength.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biotin <meta charset="utf-8"> <b>(Vitamin B7)</b></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>An essential B vitamin that assists skin, hair and nail health. Biotin also helps the body convert food into energy by supporting enzymes involved in the breakdown of carbs, fats and proteins. </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Erythritol, Natural Flavours, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Natural Colour (Red Beetroot Extract), Natural Sweetener (Thaumatin).</b></li>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul></ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Organic Greens Blend (Spirulina, Chlorella, Alfalfa Grass, Wheat Grass, Barley Grass)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>- Spirulina is a blue-green microalgae rich in protein, B vitamins, and antioxidants like phycocyanins.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Chlorella is a green algae that contains chlorophyll, which aids detoxification. It's also high in antioxidant compounds, such as carotenoids, like lutein, beta-carotene, and zeaxanthin.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Alfalfa Grass has a long history of use as a medicinal herb for humans. It's a good source of calcium, potassium, phosphorus, iron, and vitamins A, C, E, and K.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Wheat Grass is a great source of cleansing chlorophyll, vitamins and minerals (vitamins A, B, C, and E, iron, calcium, and magnesium), antioxidant compounds, and bioflavonoids, such as apigenin.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Barley Grass is rich in vitamins C, B, and minerals like calcium, iron, and magnesium.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<b>100% Hydrolysed Collagen Peptides (Bovine</b>)<br><span class="s1"></span>Hydrolysed bioactive collagen from grass-fed, pasture-raised bovine. A tailored blend that stimulates type 1, type 2, and type 3 collagen. Combined, these promote healthy hair, skin, and nails, improve joint function, and support gut health.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="li2">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Super Fruit Juice Blend (Blackcurrant, Raspberry, Strawberry, Pomegranate, Blueberry, Cranberry, Elderberry, Acai, Goji)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>These 5 super fruits offer a high concentration of vitamins, minerals, fibre, and antioxidants. <br><br><span class="s1"></span>Of particular importance for beauty and overall health is vitamin C, which may help protect against oxidative stress by scavenging destructive free radicals and stimulating the body's natural production of collagen, plus hyaluronic acid. <br><br>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Organic Fruit and Vegetable Blend (Beetroot, Carrot, Kale, Spinach, Acai, Grape, Apple, Broccoli Sprout)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>Eight incredibly nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables with high amounts of essential vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fibre that you may be missing out on your daily diet. <br><br><span class="s1"></span>An unfamiliar ingredient that might have caught your eye is Broccoli Sprout — this refers to a 3-5 day-old broccoli seed sprout that offers more nutrition benefits than the mature plant, including increased concentrations of powerful antioxidants like vitamin C and a phytochemical called sulforaphane. <br><br>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Natural Sea Mineral Complex<br></b><span class="s1"></span>Derived from red marine algae. A rich source of bioavailable calcium and 72 trace minerals, including magnesium, iron, and selenium, Natural Sea Mineral Complex offers a fuss-free way to fill the nutrition gaps in your diet. <br><br>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Prebiotics (Partially Hydrolysed Guar Gum, Chicory Root Fibre, Acacia Fibre, Organic Green Banana Resistant Starch Powder)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>These 4 prebiotic fibres aren't digestible by your body, so they travel down to your lower digestive tract relatively intact and become a crucial food source for your gut's friendly microorganisms. <br><br><span class="s1"></span>This encourages a balanced gut microbiome, which promotes an optimal environment for your digestive system and overall health.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="li2">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Probiotics Blend (<i>Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum</i>)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>If prebiotics are "fertilisers" for beneficial gut microbes, probiotics are the "seeds" that'll populate your digestive tract and improve the composition of your gut microbiome. <br><br><span class="s1"></span>Different strains of probiotics perform different biological actions in the gut; the 5 probiotic strains in Super Beauty Greens were specifically selected for their unique and synergistic benefits in supporting overall health, vitality, gut, and immune support. <br><br>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Digestive Enzyme Blend (Protease, Amylase, Lipase, Cellulase, Lactase)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>A comprehensive blend of 5 digestive enzymes that support good digestion — promoting optimal nutrient absorption while minimising the occasional gas and bloating. <br><span class="s1"></span>- Protease enzymes break down proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids for absorption. <br>- Amylase enzymes break down carbohydrates into simpler sugars like glucose for absorption.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Lipase enzymes break down dietary fats into fatty acids and glycerol for absorption.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Cellulase enzymes break down cellulose, a plant fibre humans can't digest without assistance.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Lactase enzymes break down lactose, the sugar found in dairy products. <br><br><b></b>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<b>Herbal Extract Blend (L-theanine, Panax Ginseng, Cacao Bean Polyphenols, Milk Thistle, Gotu Kola)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>A blend of natural, energising actives that'll have you maintaining peak performance from day to night. Get ready to live your best life.</li>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul></ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Organic Greens Blend (Spirulina, Chlorella, Alfalfa Grass, Wheat Grass, Barley Grass)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>- Spirulina is a blue-green microalgae rich in protein, B vitamins, and antioxidants like phycocyanins.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Chlorella is a green algae that contains chlorophyll, which aids detoxification. It's also high in antioxidant compounds, such as carotenoids, like lutein, beta-carotene, and zeaxanthin.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Alfalfa Grass has a long history of use as a medicinal herb for humans. It's a good source of calcium, potassium, phosphorus, iron, and vitamins A, C, E, and K.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Wheat Grass is a great source of cleansing chlorophyll, vitamins and minerals (vitamins A, B, C, and E, iron, calcium, and magnesium), antioxidant compounds, and bioflavonoids, such as apigenin.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Barley Grass is rich in vitamins C, B, and minerals like calcium, iron, and magnesium.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<b>100% Hydrolysed Collagen Peptides (Bovine</b>)<br><span class="s1"></span>Hydrolysed bioactive collagen from grass-fed, pasture-raised bovine. A tailored blend that stimulates type 1, type 2, and type 3 collagen. Combined, these promote healthy hair, skin, and nails, improve joint function, and support gut health.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="li2">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Super Fruit Juice Blend (Blackcurrant, Raspberry, Strawberry, Pomegranate, Blueberry, Cranberry, Elderberry, Acai, Goji)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>These 5 super fruits offer a high concentration of vitamins, minerals, fibre, and antioxidants. <br><br><span class="s1"></span>Of particular importance for beauty and overall health is vitamin C, which may help protect against oxidative stress by scavenging destructive free radicals and stimulating the body's natural production of collagen, plus hyaluronic acid. <br><br>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Organic Fruit and Vegetable Blend (Beetroot, Carrot, Kale, Spinach, Acai, Grape, Apple, Broccoli Sprout)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>Eight incredibly nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables with high amounts of essential vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fibre that you may be missing out on your daily diet. <br><br><span class="s1"></span>An unfamiliar ingredient that might have caught your eye is Broccoli Sprout — this refers to a 3-5 day-old broccoli seed sprout that offers more nutrition benefits than the mature plant, including increased concentrations of powerful antioxidants like vitamin C and a phytochemical called sulforaphane. <br><br>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Natural Sea Mineral Complex<br></b><span class="s1"></span>Derived from red marine algae. A rich source of bioavailable calcium and 72 trace minerals, including magnesium, iron, and selenium, Natural Sea Mineral Complex offers a fuss-free way to fill the nutrition gaps in your diet. <br><br>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Prebiotics (Partially Hydrolysed Guar Gum, Chicory Root Fibre, Acacia Fibre, Organic Green Banana Resistant Starch Powder)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>These 4 prebiotic fibres aren't digestible by your body, so they travel down to your lower digestive tract relatively intact and become a crucial food source for your gut's friendly microorganisms. <br><br><span class="s1"></span>This encourages a balanced gut microbiome, which promotes an optimal environment for your digestive system and overall health.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="li2">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Probiotics Blend (<i>Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum</i>)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>If prebiotics are "fertilisers" for beneficial gut microbes, probiotics are the "seeds" that'll populate your digestive tract and improve the composition of your gut microbiome. <br><br><span class="s1"></span>Different strains of probiotics perform different biological actions in the gut; the 5 probiotic strains in Super Beauty Greens were specifically selected for their unique and synergistic benefits in supporting overall health, vitality, gut, and immune support. <br><br>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Digestive Enzyme Blend (Protease, Amylase, Lipase, Cellulase, Lactase)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>A comprehensive blend of 5 digestive enzymes that support good digestion — promoting optimal nutrient absorption while minimising the occasional gas and bloating. <br><span class="s1"></span>- Protease enzymes break down proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids for absorption. <br>- Amylase enzymes break down carbohydrates into simpler sugars like glucose for absorption.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Lipase enzymes break down dietary fats into fatty acids and glycerol for absorption.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Cellulase enzymes break down cellulose, a plant fibre humans can't digest without assistance.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Lactase enzymes break down lactose, the sugar found in dairy products. <br><br><b></b>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<b>Herbal Extract Blend (L-theanine, Panax Ginseng, Cacao Bean Polyphenols, Milk Thistle, Gotu Kola)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>A blend of natural, energising actives that'll have you maintaining peak performance from day to night. Get ready to live your best life.</li>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<li><b>100% Hydrolyzed Collagen Peptides (Bovine)</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hydrolyzed bioactive collagen from grass-fed, pasture-raised bovine. A tailored blend that stimulates type 1, type 2 and type 3 collagen. Combined, these promote healthy hair, skin and nails, improve joint function and support gut health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A polysaccharide that occurs naturally in your skin. Hyaluronic Acid acts like a tiny sponge that pulls in water to quench and plump skin–giving it that dewy, glowy effect. It also keeps the joints lubricated and helps preserve bone strength.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biotin <meta charset="utf-8">(Vitamin B7)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>An essential B vitamin that assists skin, hair and nail health. Biotin also helps the body convert food into energy by supporting enzymes involved in the breakdown of carbs, fats and proteins. </p>

<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Versatility isn’t our Unflavoured Collagen Powder’s only winning trait. There’s also efficacy — thanks to its highly-targeted and generous dosing of Hydrolysed Bovine Collagen Powder, Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, and Biotin. </span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">With this supercharged blend working to help your hair, skin, nails, joints, and gut get their glow on … premature ageing and “bad” gut bacteria won’t stand a chance.</span> <meta charset="utf-8"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">*Scoop included.</span></p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Your anti-ageing routine made easy. Our Premium Collagen Peptides deliver 15 grams of potent Hydrolysed Bovine Collagen Peptides per serving — revitalising you from head to toe for your healthiest hair, skin, nails, joints, and gut yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">More reasons to love our collagen peptides? We can think of 3. One: they’re grass-fed and pasture-raised. Two: they're tiny (less than 2 kDa on average), so they get absorbed and work </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">fast</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Finally: they’re packed with Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, and Biotin:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Vitamin C shields your skin from free radicals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Hyaluronic Acid binds water for a firm complexion and well-lubricated joints</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Biotin aids energy production for resilient hair, skin, and nails</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>100% Hydrolyzed Collagen Peptides (Bovine)</strong></span></li>

A tailored blend that stimulates type 1, type 2 and type 3 collagen. Combined, these promote healthy hair, skin and nails, improve joint function and support gut health.</span></p>

<p>Essential for collagen biosynthesis and the formation of collagen fibres. Vitamin C is also a powerful antioxidant that boosts the immune system and helps the body absorb iron. </p>
