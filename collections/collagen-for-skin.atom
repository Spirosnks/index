<span class="s1"></span><b>Organic Greens Blend (Spirulina, Chlorella, Alfalfa Grass, Wheat Grass, Barley Grass)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>- Spirulina is a blue-green microalgae rich in protein, B vitamins, and antioxidants like phycocyanins.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Chlorella is a green algae that contains chlorophyll, which aids detoxification. It's also high in antioxidant compounds, such as carotenoids, like lutein, beta-carotene, and zeaxanthin.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Alfalfa Grass has a long history of use as a medicinal herb for humans. It's a good source of calcium, potassium, phosphorus, iron, and vitamins A, C, E, and K.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Wheat Grass is a great source of cleansing chlorophyll, vitamins and minerals (vitamins A, B, C, and E, iron, calcium, and magnesium), antioxidant compounds, and bioflavonoids, such as apigenin.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Barley Grass is rich in vitamins C, B, and minerals like calcium, iron, and magnesium.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<b>100% Hydrolysed Collagen Peptides (Bovine</b>)<br><span class="s1"></span>Hydrolysed bioactive collagen from grass-fed, pasture-raised bovine. A tailored blend that stimulates type 1, type 2, and type 3 collagen. Combined, these promote healthy hair, skin, and nails, improve joint function, and support gut health.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="li2">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Super Fruit Juice Blend (Blackcurrant, Raspberry, Strawberry, Pomegranate, Blueberry, Cranberry, Elderberry, Acai, Goji)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>These 5 super fruits offer a high concentration of vitamins, minerals, fibre, and antioxidants. <br><br><span class="s1"></span>Of particular importance for beauty and overall health is vitamin C, which may help protect against oxidative stress by scavenging destructive free radicals and stimulating the body's natural production of collagen, plus hyaluronic acid. <br><br>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Organic Fruit and Vegetable Blend (Beetroot, Carrot, Kale, Spinach, Acai, Grape, Apple, Broccoli Sprout)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>Eight incredibly nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables with high amounts of essential vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fibre that you may be missing out on your daily diet. <br><br><span class="s1"></span>An unfamiliar ingredient that might have caught your eye is Broccoli Sprout — this refers to a 3-5 day-old broccoli seed sprout that offers more nutrition benefits than the mature plant, including increased concentrations of powerful antioxidants like vitamin C and a phytochemical called sulforaphane. <br><br>

<span class="s1"></span><b>Prebiotics (Partially Hydrolysed Guar Gum, Chicory Root Fibre, Acacia Fibre, Organic Green Banana Resistant Starch Powder)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>These 4 prebiotic fibres aren't digestible by your body, so they travel down to your lower digestive tract relatively intact and become a crucial food source for your gut's friendly microorganisms. <br><br><span class="s1"></span>This encourages a balanced gut microbiome, which promotes an optimal environment for your digestive system and overall health.<br><br>
</li>

<span class="s1"></span><b>Probiotics Blend (<i>Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum</i>)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>If prebiotics are "fertilisers" for beneficial gut microbes, probiotics are the "seeds" that'll populate your digestive tract and improve the composition of your gut microbiome. <br><br><span class="s1"></span>Different strains of probiotics perform different biological actions in the gut; the 5 probiotic strains in Super Beauty Greens were specifically selected for their unique and synergistic benefits in supporting overall health, vitality, gut, and immune support. <br><br>

<li class="li1">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Digestive Enzyme Blend (Protease, Amylase, Lipase, Cellulase, Lactase)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>A comprehensive blend of 5 digestive enzymes that support good digestion — promoting optimal nutrient absorption while minimising the occasional gas and bloating. <br><span class="s1"></span>- Protease enzymes break down proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids for absorption. <br>- Amylase enzymes break down carbohydrates into simpler sugars like glucose for absorption.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Lipase enzymes break down dietary fats into fatty acids and glycerol for absorption.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Cellulase enzymes break down cellulose, a plant fibre humans can't digest without assistance.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Lactase enzymes break down lactose, the sugar found in dairy products. <br><br><b></b>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul></ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Organic Greens Blend (Spirulina, Chlorella, Alfalfa Grass, Wheat Grass, Barley Grass)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>- Spirulina is a blue-green microalgae rich in protein, B vitamins, and antioxidants like phycocyanins.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Chlorella is a green algae that contains chlorophyll, which aids detoxification. It's also high in antioxidant compounds, such as carotenoids, like lutein, beta-carotene, and zeaxanthin.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Alfalfa Grass has a long history of use as a medicinal herb for humans. It's a good source of calcium, potassium, phosphorus, iron, and vitamins A, C, E, and K.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Wheat Grass is a great source of cleansing chlorophyll, vitamins and minerals (vitamins A, B, C, and E, iron, calcium, and magnesium), antioxidant compounds, and bioflavonoids, such as apigenin.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Barley Grass is rich in vitamins C, B, and minerals like calcium, iron, and magnesium.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<b>100% Hydrolysed Collagen Peptides (Bovine</b>)<br><span class="s1"></span>Hydrolysed bioactive collagen from grass-fed, pasture-raised bovine. A tailored blend that stimulates type 1, type 2, and type 3 collagen. Combined, these promote healthy hair, skin, and nails, improve joint function, and support gut health.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="li2">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Super Fruit Juice Blend (Blackcurrant, Raspberry, Strawberry, Pomegranate, Blueberry, Cranberry, Elderberry, Acai, Goji)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>These 5 super fruits offer a high concentration of vitamins, minerals, fibre, and antioxidants. <br><br><span class="s1"></span>Of particular importance for beauty and overall health is vitamin C, which may help protect against oxidative stress by scavenging destructive free radicals and stimulating the body's natural production of collagen, plus hyaluronic acid. <br><br>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Organic Fruit and Vegetable Blend (Beetroot, Carrot, Kale, Spinach, Acai, Grape, Apple, Broccoli Sprout)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>Eight incredibly nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables with high amounts of essential vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fibre that you may be missing out on your daily diet. <br><br><span class="s1"></span>An unfamiliar ingredient that might have caught your eye is Broccoli Sprout — this refers to a 3-5 day-old broccoli seed sprout that offers more nutrition benefits than the mature plant, including increased concentrations of powerful antioxidants like vitamin C and a phytochemical called sulforaphane. <br><br>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Natural Sea Mineral Complex<br></b><span class="s1"></span>Derived from red marine algae. A rich source of bioavailable calcium and 72 trace minerals, including magnesium, iron, and selenium, Natural Sea Mineral Complex offers a fuss-free way to fill the nutrition gaps in your diet. <br><br>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Prebiotics (Partially Hydrolysed Guar Gum, Chicory Root Fibre, Acacia Fibre, Organic Green Banana Resistant Starch Powder)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>These 4 prebiotic fibres aren't digestible by your body, so they travel down to your lower digestive tract relatively intact and become a crucial food source for your gut's friendly microorganisms. <br><br><span class="s1"></span>This encourages a balanced gut microbiome, which promotes an optimal environment for your digestive system and overall health.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="li2">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Probiotics Blend (<i>Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum</i>)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>If prebiotics are "fertilisers" for beneficial gut microbes, probiotics are the "seeds" that'll populate your digestive tract and improve the composition of your gut microbiome. <br><br><span class="s1"></span>Different strains of probiotics perform different biological actions in the gut; the 5 probiotic strains in Super Beauty Greens were specifically selected for their unique and synergistic benefits in supporting overall health, vitality, gut, and immune support. <br><br>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<span class="s1"></span><b>Digestive Enzyme Blend (Protease, Amylase, Lipase, Cellulase, Lactase)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>A comprehensive blend of 5 digestive enzymes that support good digestion — promoting optimal nutrient absorption while minimising the occasional gas and bloating. <br><span class="s1"></span>- Protease enzymes break down proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids for absorption. <br>- Amylase enzymes break down carbohydrates into simpler sugars like glucose for absorption.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Lipase enzymes break down dietary fats into fatty acids and glycerol for absorption.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Cellulase enzymes break down cellulose, a plant fibre humans can't digest without assistance.<br><span class="s1"></span>- Lactase enzymes break down lactose, the sugar found in dairy products. <br><br><b></b>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<b>Herbal Extract Blend (L-theanine, Panax Ginseng, Cacao Bean Polyphenols, Milk Thistle, Gotu Kola)<br></b><span class="s1"></span>A blend of natural, energising actives that'll have you maintaining peak performance from day to night. Get ready to live your best life.</li>

    <td colspan="2"><h2>Description</h2>
<p><i>Marine collagen peptides, but not the ones you know. Because we make ours from fish scales — these contain the most collagen content among fish parts without that undesirable fishy smell and taste. And it's not just any fish scales. But instead, wild-caught ones off Australia's pristine coastal waters. Your skin, hair, nails, joints, and gut are in for a treat.</i></p>
<p>Beyond its versatility, the Unflavoured Beauty Marine Collagen Powder boasts exceptional efficacy. This is attributed to its carefully calibrated blend featuring abundant doses of Hydrolysed Marine Collagen Powder, Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, and Niacinamide.</p>
<p>This powerful combination is dedicated to enhancing the radiance of your hair, skin, nails, joints, and gut. With this potent blend at work, premature ageing can be effectively prevented.</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p><i>Not</i> your typical 3-gram-per-serving marine collagen powder. Fueled by 10 grams of 100% pure Marine Collagen Peptides per serving, Beauty Marine Collagen is on a mission to illuminate, plump, hydrate, and restore; all in one. As with all our products, our marine collagen peptides are thoughtfully broken down until they're digestion-bypassing-tiny (a molecular size of less than 2 kDa on average).</p>
<p><span>Finally: they’re packed with Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, and Niacinamide:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Vitamin C shields your skin from free radicals</span></li>
<li><span>Hyaluronic Acid binds water for a firm complexion and well-lubricated joints</span></li>
<li><span>Niacinamide helps to maintain skin moisture and strengthen the skin barrier. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>So, why settle for the rest when you can have the best?</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>100% Pure Marine Collagen Peptides</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>10,000mg of Hydrolysed Marine Collagen Peptides created from sustainably sourced, wild caught fish scales from the coastal waters of Australia. With an average molecular weight of less than 2kDa, our PUREACOL MARINE™ Collagen Peptides are designed for optimum absorption and bioavailability.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)<br></b></li>
</ul>
<p>Essential for collagen biosynthesis and the formation of collagen fibres. Vitamin C is also a powerful antioxidant that boosts the immune system and helps the body absorb iron. </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid)<br></b></li>
</ul>
<p>A polysaccharide that occurs naturally in your skin. Hyaluronic Acid acts like a tiny sponge that pulls in water to quench and plump skin–giving it that dewy, glowy effect. It also keeps the joints lubricated and helps preserve bone strength.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Vitamin B3 (Niacinamide)<br></b></li>
</ul>
<p>Aids in retaining skin moisture, fortifying the skin barrier, and reducing inflammation of the skin, commonly caused by skin conditions such as eczema and rosacea.</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<p><b><strong>How many serves a day?</strong><br></b>How much collagen you should take each day depends on your own health goals. Between 10-30grams of collagen peptides a day will give you visible results.<br><br>One serve a day is ideal if you want to combat fine lines and wrinkles, improve your hair and nail strength, ease joint pain, build muscle, improve gut health and get an overall energy boost.<br><br>Two serves a day will fast track your results. Have one serve morning and evening.<b><br><br><strong>Storage:</strong> </b>Store in a cool, dark place out of direct sunlight.</p>

Each serve packs a remarkable 10,000mg of pure Australian marine collagen, Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, and Niacinamide, ensuring you receive a generous dose of its nourishing benefits with every serving. </p>
<h3><strong>What’s the difference between Beauty Marine Collagen and Premium Collagen Peptides?</strong></h3>
<p>If you're contemplating which option suits you best, the decision ultimately boils down to your dietary preferences. Premium Collagen Peptides harness the power of hydrolyzed bovine collagen, stimulating the production of type 1, 2, and 3 collagens in the body. On the other hand, Beauty Marine Collagen utilises Pure Australian marine collagen, which contains type 1 collagen. <br><br>Rest assured, both options deliver radiant skin, lustrous hair, strong nails, and provide support for joint and gut health.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><h2>Description</h2>
<p>There are 14 sachets in the Mixed Collagen Sachet box - 2 Unflavoured, 3 Passionfruit Mango, 3 Strawberry Watermelon, 3 Mixed Berry and 3 Purple Grape. No matter which tantalising flavour ends up in your favourite foods and beverages, you’re sure to experience the same inside-out, on-the-go, glow-up effects every time.</p>
<p>That’s because they contain the same potent, anti-ageing ingredients: Hydrolysed Bovine Collagen Powder, Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, and Biotin.</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>Catering to all your beauty and wellness needs is a scientifically formulated, potent mix of youth-promoting ingredients. 15 grams of 100% pure, grass-fed, and pasture-raised Hydrolysed Bovine Collagen Peptides are just the start.</p>

<p>You'll also find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin C, a free radical-fighting antioxidant that promotes a firm, radiant complexion</li>
<li>Hyaluronic Acid, a hydrating superstar that keeps your joints moisturised and happy</li>
<li>Biotin, a vitamin that aids energy metabolism, encouraging healthy skin, hair, and nails (it truly puts the 'B' in Beauty!)</li>

    <td colspan="2"><h2>Description</h2>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Versatility isn’t our Unflavoured Collagen Powder’s only winning trait. There’s also efficacy — thanks to its highly-targeted and generous dosing of Hydrolysed Bovine Collagen Powder, Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, and Biotin. </span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">With this supercharged blend working to help your hair, skin, nails, joints, and gut get their glow on … premature ageing and “bad” gut bacteria won’t stand a chance.</span> <meta charset="utf-8"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">*Scoop included.</span></p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Your anti-ageing routine made easy. Our Premium Collagen Peptides deliver 15 grams of potent Hydrolysed Bovine Collagen Peptides per serving — revitalising you from head to toe for your healthiest hair, skin, nails, joints, and gut yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">More reasons to love our collagen peptides? We can think of 3. One: they’re grass-fed and pasture-raised. Two: they're tiny (less than 2 kDa on average), so they get absorbed and work </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">fast</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Finally: they’re packed with Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, and Biotin:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Vitamin C shields your skin from free radicals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Hyaluronic Acid binds water for a firm complexion and well-lubricated joints</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Biotin aids energy production for resilient hair, skin, and nails</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>100% Hydrolyzed Collagen Peptides (Bovine)</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Hydrolyzed bioactive collagen from grass-fed, pasture-raised bovine. A tailored blend that stimulates type 1, type 2 and type 3 collagen. Combined, these promote healthy hair, skin and nails, improve joint function and support gut health.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Essential for collagen biosynthesis and the formation of collagen fibres. Vitamin C is also a powerful antioxidant that boosts the immune system and helps the body absorb iron. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A polysaccharide that occurs naturally in your skin. Hyaluronic Acid acts like a tiny sponge that pulls in water to quench and plump skin–giving it that dewy, glowy effect. It also keeps the joints lubricated and helps preserve bone strength.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biotin (Vitamin B7)<br></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>An essential B vitamin that assists skin, hair and nail health. Biotin also helps the body convert food into energy by supporting enzymes involved in the breakdown of carbs, fats and proteins. </p>
